Based on the context and description provided, here is a more fleshed out version of the UX component in code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './UX.css';
import AIButler from './AIButler';
import InteractiveMetaverse from './InteractiveMetaverse';
import GamifiedLearning from './GamifiedLearning';

class UX extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            features: [
                {
                    title: 'Personalized AI Butler',
                    description: 'Experience a personalized AI butler that can assist you with managing tasks and providing recommendations.'
                },
                {
                    title: 'Interactive Metaverse',
                    description: 'Explore an interactive metaverse, complete tasks, and interact with AI agents to solve virtual challenges.'
                },
                {
                    title: 'Gamified Learning',
                    description: 'Engage in gamified learning experiences that educate you on leveraging the platform\'s features.'
                }
            ]
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="ux-container">
                <h1>Welcome to Elysium Innovations' Interactive AI Metaverse Demo</h1>
                <p>Experience a personalized AI butler, explore an interactive metaverse, and engage in gamified learning experiences.</p>
                <div className="ux-features">
                    {this.state.features.map(feature => (
                        <div className="ux-feature" key={feature.title}>
                            <h2>{feature.title}</h2>
                            <p>{feature.description}</p>
                        </div>
                    ))}
                    <AIButler />
                    <InteractiveMetaverse />
                    <GamifiedLearning />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default UX;
```

Here, each feature, including the AI Butler, Interactive Metaverse, and Gamified Learning, have their own separate components (`AIButler`, `InteractiveMetaverse`, `GamifiedLearning`). This helps in maintaining the principle of single responsibility and makes the code more maintainable and scalable.

This also abstracts the feature's specific implementation details out of `UX` and into their respective components as per the guiding principle you've mentioned. If any, further modifications are needed, these would then be made in the respective feature component file, thus reducing the potential complexity. 

Note: The AI Butler, Interactive Metaverse, and Gamified Learning components aren't provided here. They would need to be defined in their own individual files (`AIButler.js`, `InteractiveMetaverse.js`, `GamifiedLearning.js`).
