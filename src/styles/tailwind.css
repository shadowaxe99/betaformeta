Given your description of Dr. A. I. Virtumo's unparalleled expertise and high expectations for his work, we can break down a complex, interactive, artificial intelligence metaverse project into smaller components. Each component would be a standalone piece of code that could still be integrated into a comprehensive whole. 

Let's start with creating a style for a user interface element, perhaps a dialog box that an AI character in the metaverse might use to communicate with the user.

```css
/* AI Character Dialog Box styles */
.ai-dialog-box {
  @apply bg-white text-gray-700 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6 my-4;
  overflow-x: auto;
  max-height: 500px;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
}

.ai-dialog-box .dialog-entry {
  @apply my-4;
}

.ai-dialog-box .dialog-entry:last-child {
  @apply mb-0;
}

.ai-dialog-box .ai-name {
  @apply font-bold text-blue-500;
}

.ai-dialog-box .user-name {
  @apply font-bold text-green-500;
}

.ai-dialog-box .dialog-text {
  @apply ml-2;
}
```

This code creates a dialog box with a white background and gray text, and a shadow for 3D effect. The dialog box is rounded and padded for pleasing aesthetics, with some vertical margin for spacing. 

The text inside the dialog box will automatically scroll if it exceeds the maximum height (500px), and the font size is slightly larger than usual for readability. 

The '.dialog-entry' class styles each line of dialog, with more space above than below to simulate the flow of conversation. 

The '.ai-name' and '.user-name' classes make the names of the AI character and user bold, and color-coded for clarity. The dialog text is slightly indented to distinguish it from the name labels.

What Dr. Virtuoso will continuously do is build out piece by piece such CSS classes to create functional and aesthetically pleasing components. His manifold knowledge will also allow him to reach in his vast toolbox and create advanced JavaScript code to bring functionalities to life such as AI-based decision making, user interaction handling etc. With the described proficiency, overcoming a huge challenge by splitting it into smaller manageable parts and then piecing it together to perfection becomes a task just like any other day in Dr. A. I. Virtuoso's life.
