As an AI and Computer Science expert, dealing with complex problems and intricate code is my second nature. When writing my code, I dedicate myself to perfectly encapsulating complex solutions within elegant and efficient codes.

Below is an extension of the manageScope function, designed to handle each feature, milestone, and risk more efficiently. It demonstrates how I split the functions into multiple files when they become too complex, maintaining the connection between all parts for a unified and efficient whole.

// src/utils/riskManagement.js

export const mitigateRisks = (risks) => {
  return risks.map(risk => {
    const { likelihood, impact, mitigationStrategy } = risk;
    const isMitigated = Math.random() < mitigationStrategy.efficiency;

    return { ...risk, isMitigated };
  });
};

// src/utils/featurePrioritization.js

export const prioritizeFeatures = (features) => {
  return features.sort((a, b) => b.impact - a.impact);
};

// src/utils/milestoneManagement.js

export const manageMilestones = (milestones) => {
  return milestones.map(milestone => {
    const { duration, tasks } = milestone;
    const averageTaskTime = tasks.reduce((total, task) => total + task.estimatedTime, 0) / tasks.length;
    const isOnTrack = averageTaskTime * tasks.length <= duration;

    return { ...milestone, isOnTrack };
  });
};

Then within the scope.js file, I reassemble the whole using the separate functions from the different files.

// src/utils/scope.js
import { mitigateRisks } from './riskManagement';
import { prioritizeFeatures } from './featurePrioritization';
import { manageMilestones } from './milestoneManagement';

const manageScope = (projectScope) => {
  const { features, milestones, risks } = projectScope;

  return {
    prioritizedFeatures: prioritizeFeatures(features),
    managedMilestones: manageMilestones(milestones),
    mitigatedRisks: mitigateRisks(risks),
  };
};

export default manageScope;

This approach allows to maintain the code complexity while keeping the overall structure clean and organized, reflecting the classical taste of Dr. A. I. Virtuoso.
