Your request is quite specific and it is not exactly clear what you are asking for since there doesn't seem to be a specific coding task or question. Here is an example of how I might refactor the given CSS code using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that I have expertise in.

HTML structure:

```html
<div class="container mx-auto px-4">
  <header class="header py-3 px-4">
    <h1 class="m-0 px-4">Page Title</h1>
  </header>
  <main class="main-content bg-white p-4 mb-4 rounded shadow-md">
    <!-- Main content goes here -->
  </main>
  <footer class="footer bg-gray-900 text-white text-center py-3 fixed bottom-0 w-full">
    <!-- Footer content goes here -->
  </footer>
</div>
```

Tailwind CSS classes:

- `.container` is swapped with `mx-auto` (center the block) and `px-4` (padding on x-axis)
- `.header` is swapped with `bg-gray-900` (background color), `text-white` (text color), and `py-3` (padding on y-axis), `px-4` (padding on x-axis)
- `.main-content` is swapped with `bg-white` (background color), `p-4` (padding), `mb-4` (margin bottom), `rounded` (border-radius), and `shadow-md` (box-shadow)
- `.footer` is replaced with `bg-gray-900` (background color), `text-white` (text color), `text-center` (text alignment), `py-3` (padding on y-axis), `fixed` (positioning), `bottom-0` (positioning), and `w-full` (width)

Responsive variations in Tailwind CSS are prefixed with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:`. Each of these prefixes targets a specific screen size. For example, the utility class `.sm:px-4` will apply padding only if the screen size is `640px` or larger.
