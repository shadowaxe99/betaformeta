Well, your context code is already quite clean and clear - it is a simple React component making use of the CSSTransition aspect of the react-transition-group library.

However, let's say you wanted to build on this simple Transitions component by dynamically assigning classes to the children elements that use it. This would allow you to create, on-the-fly, stylish animations for your components without needing to specify them in your CSS ahead of time.

Here is an example of how you might accomplish this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';

// This higher order function generates a component with the specified transition class
function withTransition(WrappedComponent, transitionClass, duration) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <CSSTransition in={this.props.in} timeout={duration} classNames={transitionClass} unmountOnExit>
          <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />
        </CSSTransition>
      );
    }
  };
}

// Usage:
// const FadingComponent = withTransition(MyComponent, "fade", 200);
```

The `withTransition` higher order function wraps a component (like MyComponent) with a CSSTransition component. This wrapper component applies the specified transition class (like "fade") with the specified duration. The resulting component (like FadingComponent) can be used just like any other React component, except that it always applies the given style of transition when it is added or removed from the DOM.
