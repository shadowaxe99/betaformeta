Sorry, but it's not clear what you are asking for. Are you looking for a more complex example of a React component? Do you want code that demonstrates a particular concept or technique? Could you please provide more specific details or a scenario to base the code on? It would be helpful if you could define the functional requirements of the software, its intended audience, and the development environment. This will help me provide you with the best possible solution.

However, given your text, I assume you're looking for a more advanced usage of React (or potentially other technologies). Please confirm whether my assumptions are correct. If so, could you please provide more details about functionalities and features you want to implement? For example:

- Do you want state management (how do you plan to manage state, local or global?)
- Do you need routing capabilities?
- What's the type of project (Single Page Application, Mobile App)?
- What sort of back-end are you working with (e.g., GraphQL, REST API)?
- Any UI/UX frameworks in mind (MaterialUI, AntDesign, TailwindCSS)?

Once we have more background information, it becomes much easier to provide a guiding example.
