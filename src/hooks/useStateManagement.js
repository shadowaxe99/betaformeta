It seems like you're asking for a demonstration of code, but there isn't a particular problem to solve or task to be completed. So, I will create a small example of a complex feature being divided across different files using modular code principles, demonstrating what you described in your request.

Let's create a hypothetical scenario where we are building a machine learning model to perform sentiment analysis on user feedback for a company. In this scenario, we could divide the project across different files as such:

#### File `utils.js`:
This file contains utility functions that can be used across different parts of the project. Let's export one function as an example:

```jsx
// Generic utility to clean text
export const cleanText = (text) => {
  // Perform cleaning steps like removing special characters, lowercasing, etc.
  return cleanedText;
}
```

#### File `nlpModels.js`:
This file hosts our natural language processing models. We import our utility function here and apply it to input text before feeding it to our model.

```jsx
import { cleanText } from './utils';

// Mock function for sentiment analysis
export const sentimentAnalysis = (text) => {
  const cleanedText = cleanText(text);
  // Perform sentiment analysis on cleaned text and return result
  return sentiment;
}
```

#### File `feedbackHandler.js`:
This is where we handle the user feedback. We import our sentiment analysis model here to apply it on the feedback we get from each user.

```jsx
import { sentimentAnalysis } from './nlpModels';

export const handleFeedback = (feedback) => {
  const sentiment = sentimentAnalysis(feedback);
  // handle feedback based on sentiment analysis result
  // e.g., escalate negative feedback, send positive feedback to marketing department, etc.
}
```

With this setup, we've divided our complex feature into manageable, modular parts that are handled in separate files, making the code easier to understand and maintain. Each part of the process is abstracted into its own function, and we can easily test and modify each part independently. This also provides us with the flexibility to replace or upgrade specific components of the project, for instance, if a better technique for text cleaning or a superior natural language model becomes available.
