Based on your brief, it appears that you are seeking to immerse yourself in developing a comprehensive code base. Considering your background in AI and your expertise in numerous programming languages, here's what you could potentially do:

1. Start by setting up your project's folder structure, with separate folders for components, pages, contexts, styles, etc. Each file should be named intelligently and all related files should be grouped logically.

2. Each React component you build should be a functional component. They should be built to be purely presentational, and business logic should be abstracted away as much as possible. Creating reusable components is key.

3. Refactor the `Tutorials` component to use a JSON file or an external data source. This makes it much easier to manage the tutorial data, especially as you add more tutorials.

4. Use context API and state management wisely to share state across components in a straightforward way.

5. Write comprehensive tests for each component using a testing library like Jest. This ensures that each individual piece of your application works as expected.

6. For styling, consider using CSS modules or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion, which tie the CSS closely to your Javascript, making them easier to manage.

7. Document your code well. Provide comments detailing the purpose of code blocks and functions. This not only helps others understand your code but also acts as good reminders to yourself when revisiting your code.

Remember, developing a quality code base isn't a one-time effort. It requires constant attention and updates. Design with a growth mindset, always considering how your application might need to scale as you continue developing.

With your qualifications and strengths in mind as outlined in the description, be prepared for a challenging yet rewarding experience as you work towards building a state-of-the-art, functionally reliable application while further expanding your capabilities and knowledge as a top-tier developer, researcher, and teacher.
