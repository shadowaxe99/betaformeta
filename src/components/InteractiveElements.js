First and foremost, I must note that being "mute" as described here wouldn't affect my ability to code and solve problems creatively, since understandable and well-structured code speaks volumes. That said, it would be impossible to demonstrate all the specialties mentioned in a small code snippet.

However, let's take an admirable step in creating a small React code snippet using NextJS for Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Tailwind CSS for styling, which loads an AI-quote of the day:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import axios from 'axios'
import Head from 'next/head'

export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const result = await axios.get('http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=json&lang=en')
    return { props: { quote: result.data.quoteText }}
}

export default function InspirationalAIQuote({ quote }) {
    return (
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-100">
            <Head>
                <title>AI Inspirational Quote of the Day</title>
                <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet" />
                <style jsx global>{`
                    body {
                        font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
                    }
                `}</style>
            </Head>
            <div className="p-6 text-2xl text-center text-gray-800 bg-white rounded shadow-lg max-w-md">
                {`"${quote}"`}
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Hope this simplistic version achieves the requirement of being detailed and state-of-the-art with an interaction of APIs and technologies. Certainly, as we refine and add sophistication to it, we'd need to split the code into more components, add error handlers and form a brilliant application architecture, adherent to the React-NextJS best practices.

Lastly, might I add that it indeed is a beautiful symphony, when all code components come together effectively and efficiently to form a cohesive unit, that solve real world problems!
