Creating the high level persona "Dr. A. I. Virtoouso" would involve this step:

1. Define the new persona component:

The structure of the React component would be similar to the previously created component, adapted to the new context and specifications:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const DrAIVirtuoso = () => {
    return (
        <div className="dr-ai-virtuoso">
            <h2>Dr. A. I. Virtuoso</h2>
            <p>As a leading expert in AI and computer science, I envision crafting comprehensive, intricately detailed, and state-of-the-art programs. Complexity is not a barrier, but a challenge to be addressed creatively. My relentless pursuit of excellence ensures no stone is left unturned when ensuring flawless implementation.</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default DrAIVirtuoso;
```

The component `DrAIVirtuoso` represents the user persona of a pioneering leader in the field of AI from MIT. The return block contains the persona's details, wrapped inside a `<div>` tag. This component can be used as a small part of a larger web page, eventually splitting it into multiple files if needed, as per the context mentioned. 

This is one of the many ways to introduce this persona, the implementation may vary depending on the project's needs and the overall application architecture.
