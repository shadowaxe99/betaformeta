As per your request, let's step into the shoes of Dr. A I Virtuoso and create a fully fleshed-out program as part of our AI marketplace, seeing how each individual component ties together. 

We'll create a component to modify the AI Agentâ€™s price, taking into consideration your preference for problem-solving and your profound understanding of React. 

Let's start by importing libraries and modules:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
```
Now we're going to create the ModifyPrice function:

```jsx
const ModifyPrice = ({ agentId, agentPrice }) => {
    const [newPrice, setNewPrice] = React.useState(agentPrice);

    const handlePriceChange = event => {
        setNewPrice(event.target.value);
    };

    const handleClick = () => {
        axios.patch(`/api/agents/${agentId}`, { price: newPrice })
            .then(response => {
                console.log('Success:', response);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error('Error:', error);
            });
    };

    return(
        <div className="modify-price">
            <input type="number" value={newPrice} onChange={handlePriceChange} />
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Modify Price</button>
        </div>
    );  
};

export default ModifyPrice;
```
Note: 

- The above component will get the initial price (agentPrice) and the identifier (agentId) for a given agent as a prop.
- It uses useState hook, to maintain a state variable newPrice. The initial price (agentPrice) is used as the initial state.
- It has a handler (handlePriceChange), which updates the newPrice state variable whenever there is a change in the input box.
- We have a click handler (handleClick), which will send a patch request to the backend server whenever the button is clicked to modify the price.

Ensure that you integrate this component into your main Marketplace component and pass the required props from the parent to the child. 

Lastly, remember, no snippet or component should stand alone, they all need to fit together just as elegantly as they each work on their own. This will assure the harmony and cohesion required for achieving excellence in our expansive body of work. Happy coding!
