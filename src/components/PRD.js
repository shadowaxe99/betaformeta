Understood. As you've stated, the task is to leverage my knowledge in AI and computer science to code an intricate and fully realized project. Below is an example of how I can build components within the Elysium Innovations' Interactive AI Metaverse using React and Next.js.

```jsx
// Import necessary libraries
import React from 'react';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import AI_Butler from './AI_Butler';
import AI_Agent from './AI_Agent';
import Interactive_Metaverse from './Interactive_Metaverse';
import Gamified_Learning from './Gamified_Learning';
import UI_UX_Design from './UI_UX_Design';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

// Create the main component that runs the Elysium Innovations' Interactive AI Metaverse
const Elysium_App = () => {
  // State management
  const [userInteraction, setUserInteraction] = useState({});

  // A similar piece of logic could be used to manage state and interactions with AI and environment
  useEffect(() => {
    // Logic to handle AI and Environment interactions
    // Continually upate state based on user/AI/environment interactions
  }, [userInteraction]);

  // Function to handle user interactions
  const handleUserInteraction = (interaction) => {
    setUserInteraction(interaction);
  }

  return (
    <Router>
      <div className='App'>
        <Route exact path='/ai_butler' component={AI_Butler} />
        <Route exact path='/ai_agent' component={AI_Agent} />
        <Route exact path='/interactive_metaverse' component={Interactive_Metaverse} />
        <Route exact path='/gamified_learning' component={Gamified_Learning} />
        <Route exact path='/ui_ux_design' component={UI_UX_Design} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default Elysium_App;
```
In the code above, I have outlined the structure of a multi-page application with separate routes for each major component of the metaverse - the AI Butler, the AI Agent, the Interactive Metaverse, the Gamified Learning, and the UI/UX Design. 

We can use state management using Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks to handle user/AIs/environment interactions in our app making it more interactive. This is just a foundational framework, each component (AI_Butler, AI_Agent, Interactive_Metaverse, Gamified_Learning, UI_UX_Design) would contain the corresponding business logic as separate React components in separate files, simplifying the project structure and making the codebase easy to maintain and expand.

I will continue to tackle the coding tasks with determination and creativity, piecing together every snippet of code to form a flawless and comprehensive digital solution.
