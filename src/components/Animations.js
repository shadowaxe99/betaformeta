Here is the code for a typical game-changing project of Dr. A. I. Virtuoso which operates as an example for his exemplary standards:

```jsx
// Import necessary libraries
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

// Import previously created styled components
import { SlideInAnimation, FadeInAnimation } from './Animations';

// Import application specific actions
import { initiateActionX, completeActionY, tryActionZ } from '../actions/actionCreators';

const MemberTasks = () => {
  // Use Redux hooks to access and manipulate the state
  const members = useSelector(state => state.members);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  // Event handlers for synchronizing actions
  const handleActionX = (memberId) => {
    dispatch(initiateActionX(memberId));
    // Some granular logic to handle part X goes here
  };

  const handleActionY = (memberId) => {
    dispatch(completeActionY(memberId));
    // Some granular logic to handle part Y goes here
  };

  const handleActionZ = (memberId) => {
    dispatch(tryActionZ(memberId));
    // Some granular logic to handle part Z goes here
  };

  // Renderer for member tasks
  const memberTasks = members.map(member => (
    <FadeInAnimation key={member.id}>
      <div>
        <h2>{member.name}</h2>
        <button onClick={() => handleActionX(member.id)}>Start Action X</button>
        <button onClick={() => handleActionY(member.id)}>Complete Action Y</button>
        <button onClick={() => handleActionZ(member.id)}>Try Action Z</button>
  
        <SlideInAnimation>
          <ul>
            {member.tasks.map(task => <li key={task.id}>{task.description}</li>)}
          </ul>
        </SlideInAnimation>
      </div>
    </FadeInAnimation>
  ))

  return (
    <motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>
      {memberTasks}
    </motion.div>
  );
};

export default MemberTasks;
```

This code would partake in a Redux-based project with animations. It showcases state and logic management with actions across the app and associates animations for better UX. The Redux part would be split into action and reducer files to maintain readability and modularity.
